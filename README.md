# ‚ùì What is Cornell Monopoly?

Cornell Monopoly is an interactive, colorful game that brings your favorite Cornell locations to the Monopoly world! Filled with the places that you know and love on campus, Cornell Monopoly allows you to have fun on the go! Choose how many people you will go on this adventure with, make funny names for everyone, and get ready to roll the dice. As you travel around the board, be prepared to encounter some surprises along the way!

# üí° Features
### Local Multiplayer
Play a monopoly-style game right from your terminal with up to 3 of your closest friends. 
### Cornell-Themed Locations
Spend a night in High Rise 5, or take over the board by owning the Clocktower!
### Beautiful CLI
Despite being a command-line interface program, users can easily see their locations on the board, their balance, and the properties they own. ASCII color codes allow for a colorful, clear, and entertaining experience as players traverse the board.
### Easy to Learn
Players can follow prompts to get started, and should have no trouble controlling the game as they begin to play.
